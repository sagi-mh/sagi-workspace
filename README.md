# Workspace

This is your personal workspace for notes, drafts, and projects.

## Conventions
- `scratch.md`: ad-hoc notes and quick jots.
- `ideas/`: early-stage notes, one-file brainstorms.
- `drafts/`: maturing documents, structured outlines.
- `projects/`: per-project directories with multiple files.
- `research/`: reference material, comparisons, learnings.
- `archive/`: old or deprecated content.
